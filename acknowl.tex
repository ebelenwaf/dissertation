Like the saying goes, ``it takes a village to raise a child". This journey would not have been possible without the help of so many people. First and foremost, I would like to thank the one true ominipotent being, God for making this possible, without him i will not be where i am today. I would also like to thank my parents, Mr.Benneth and Mrs. Chinwe Nwafor for their constant encouragement, love and support. I would like to thank my advisor Dr. Gedare Bloom for his guidance and encouragement throughout this process, for believing in my research ideas and also for his constructive critique and valuable input in various drafts revisions of my dissertation. I would like to thank my committee members Dr.Rawat Danada, Dr.Legand Burge, and Dr.Charles Kim for their insightful comments and feedback.

I would like to thank some of the most amazing mentors i have been fortunate to have: Dr. Adedoyin Adeyoiga, and Dr. Deivy Peterescu. You all are a source of inspiration and a beacon of light.
