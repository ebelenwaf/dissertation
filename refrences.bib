	abstract = {Deterministic record and replay systems have widely been used in software debugging, failure diagnosis, and intrusion detection. In order to detect the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), online execution needs to be recorded with acceptable runtime overhead; then, investigators can analyze the replayed execution with heavy dynamic instrumentation. While most record and replay systems rely on kernel module or OS virtualization, those running at user space are favoured for being lighter weight and more portable without any of the changes needed for OS/Kernel virtualization. On the other hand, higher level provenance data at a higher level provides dynamic analysis with system causalities and hugely increases its efficiency. Considering both benefits, we propose a provenance-aware user space record and replay system, called RecProv. RecProv is designed to provide high provenance fidelity; specifically, with versioning files from the recorded trace logs and integrity protection to provenance data through real-time trace isolation. The collected provenance provides the high-level system dependency that helps pinpoint suspicious activities where further analysis can be applied. We show that RecProv is able to output accurate provenance in both visualized graph and W3C standardized PROV-JSON formats.},

	doi = {10.1109/PST.2012.6297930},
	abstract = {Existence of data provenance information in a system raises at least two security-related issues. One is how provenance data can be used to enhance security in the system and the other is how to protect provenance data which might be more sensitive than the data itself. Recent data provenance-related access control literature mainly focuses on the latter issue of protecting provenance data. In this paper, we propose a novel provenance-based access control model that addresses the former objective. Using provenance data for access control to the underlying data facilitates additional capabilities beyond those available in traditional access control models. We utilize a notion of dependency as the key foundation for access control policy specification. Dependency-based policy provides simplicity and effectiveness in policy specification and access control administration. We show our model can support dynamic separation of duty, workflow control, origin-based control, and object versioning. The proposed model identifies essential components and concepts and provides a foundational base model for provenance-based access control. We further discuss possible extensions of the proposed base model for enhanced access controls.},

Sensor data presents new challenges in these areas. Such data is location-specific but also distributed; it is collected in a particular physical location and may be most useful there, but it has additional value when combined with other sensor data collections in a larger distributed system. Thus, arranging location-sensitive peer-to-peer storage is one challenge. Sensor data sets do not have obvious names, so naming them in a globally useful fashion is another challenge. The last challenge arises from the need to index these sensor data sets to make them searchable. The key to sensor data identity is provenance, the full history or lineage of the data. We show how provenance addresses the naming and indexing issues and then present a research agenda for constructing distributed, indexed repositories of sensor data.},

However, existing provenance collection mechanisms fail to achieve sufficient breadth or fidelity to provide a holistic view of a system's operation over time. We present Hi-Fi, a kernel-level provenance system which leverages the Linux Security Modules framework to collect high-fidelity whole-system provenance. We demonstrate that Hi-Fi is able to record a variety of malicious behavior within a compromised system. In addition, our benchmarks show the collection overhead from Hi-Fi to be less than 1\% for most system calls and 3\% in a representative workload, while simultaneously generating a system measurement that fully reflects system evolution. In this way, we show that we can collect broad, high-fidelity provenance data which is capable of supporting detailed forensic analysis.},

In this paper we propose a universal data provenance framework, using dynamic instrumentation, which gathers data provenance information for real-world applications without any code modifications. Our framework simplifies the task of finding the right points to instrument, which can be cumbersome in large and complex systems. We have built a proof-of-concept implementation of the framework on top of DTrace. Moreover, we evaluated its functionality by using it for three different scenarios: file-system operations, database transactions and web browser HTTP requests. Based on our experiences we believe that it is possible to provide data provenance, transparently, to any layer of the software stack.},

Story Book resides in user space, and treats provenance events as a generic event log, leading to a simple, flexible and easily optimized system. We demonstrate the flexibility of our design by adding provenance to a number of different systems, including a file system, database and a number of file types, and by implementing two separate storage backends. Although Story Book is nearly 2.5 times slower than ext3 under worst case workloads, this is mostly due to FUSE message passing overhead. Our experiments show that coupling our simple design with existing storage optimizations provides higher throughput than existing systems.},

	abstract = {Gathering data provenance at the operating system level is useful for capturing system-wide activity. However, many modern programs are complex and can perform numerous tasks concurrently. Capturing their provenance at this level, where processes are treated as single entities, may lead to the loss of useful intra-process detail. This can, in turn, produce false dependencies in the provenance graph. Using the LLVM compiler framework and SPADE provenance infrastructure, we investigate adding provenance instrumentation to allow intraprocess provenance to be captured automatically. This results in a more accurate representation of the provenance relationships and eliminates some false dependencies. Since the capture of fine-grained provenance incurs increased overhead for storage and querying, we minimize the records retained by allowing users to declare aspects of interest and then automatically infer which provenance records are unnecessary and can be discarded.},

	abstract = {The cloud is poised to become the next computing environment for both data storage and computation due to its pay-as-you-go and provision-as-you-go models. Cloud storage is already being used to back up desktop user data, host shared scientific data, store web application data, and to serve web pages. Today's cloud stores, however, are missing an important ingredient: provenance. Provenance is metadata that describes the history of an object. We make the case that provenance is crucial for data stored on the cloud and identify the properties of provenance that enable its utility. We then examine current cloud offerings and design and implement three protocols for maintaining data/provenance in current cloud stores. The protocols represent different points in the design space and satisfy different subsets of the provenance properties. Our evaluation indicates that the overheads of all three protocols are comparable to each other and reasonable in absolute terms. Thus, one can select a protocol based upon the properties it provides without sacrificing performance. While it is feasible to provide provenance as a layer on top of today's cloud offerings, we conclude by presenting the case for incorporating provenance as a core cloud feature, discussing the issues in doing so.},

As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the research community. The most relevant among them are addressed in details.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicatingâactuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.},

	abstract = {As organizations become increasingly reliant on cloud computing for servicing their data storage requirements, the need to govern access control at finer granularities becomes particularly important. This challenge is increased by the lack of policy supporting data migration across geographic boundaries and through organizations with divergent regulatory policies. In this paper, we present an architecture for secure and distributed management of provenance, enabling its use in security-critical applications. Provenance, a metadata history detailing the derivation of an object, contains information that allows for expressive, policy-independent access control decisions. We consider how to manage and validate the metadata of a provenance-aware cloud system, and introduce protocols that allow for secure transfer of provenance metadata between end hosts and cloud authorities. Using these protocols, we develop a provenance-based access control mechanism for Cumulus cloud storage, capable of processing thousands of operations per second on a single deployment. Through the introduction of replicated components, we achieve overhead costs of just 14\%, demonstrating that provenance-based access control is a practical and scalable solution for the cloud.},

In this paper we describe an approach to computing provenance when the data of interest has been created by a database query. We adopt a syntactic approach and present results for a general data model that applies to relational databases as well as to hierarchical data such as XML. A novel aspect of our work is a distinction between âwhyâ provenance (refers to the source data that had some influence on the existence of the data) and âwhereâ provenance (refers to the location(s) in the source databases from which the data was extracted).

	abstract = {In many data-driven applications, analysis needs to be performed on scientific information obtained from several sources and generated by computations on distributed resources. Systematic analysis of this scientific information unleashes a growing need for automated data-driven applications that also can keep track of the provenance of the data and processes with little user interaction and overhead. Such data analysis can be facilitated by the recent advancements in scientific workflow systems. A major profit when using scientific workflow systems is the ability to make provenance collection a part of the workflow. Specifically, provenance should include not only the standard data lineage information but also information about the context in which the workflow was used, execution that processed the data, and the evolution of the workflow design. In this paper we describe a complete framework for data and process provenance in the Kepler Scientific Workflow System. We outline the requirements and issues related to data and workflow provenance in a multi-disciplinary workflow system and introduce how generic provenance capture can be facilitated in Keplerâs actor-oriented workflow environment. We also describe the usage of the stored provenance information for efficient rerun of scientific workflows.},

To address this problem, we propose a systematic method for assessing the trustworthiness of data items. Our approach uses the data provenance as well as their values in computing trust scores, that is, quantitative measures of trustworthiness. To obtain trust scores, we propose a cyclic framework which well reflects the inter-dependency property: the trust score of the data affects the trust score of the network nodes that created and manipulated the data, and vice-versa. The trust scores of data items are computed from their value similarity and provenance similarity. The value similarity comes from the principle that "the more similar values for the same event, the higher the trust scores". The provenance similarity is based on the principle that "the more different data provenances with similar values, the higher the trust scores". Experimental results show that our approach provides a practical solution for trustworthiness assessment in sensor networks.},

Intrusion detection systems are software and/or hardware components that monitor computer systems and analyze events occurring in them for signs of intrusions. Due to widespread diversity and complexity of computer infrastructures, it is difficult to provide a completely secure computer system. Therefore, there are numerous security systems and intrusion detection systems that address different aspects of computer security. This chapter first provides taxonomy of computer intrusions, along with brief descriptions of major computer attack categories. Second, a common architecture of intrusion detection systems and their basic characteristics are presented. Third, taxonomy of intrusion detection systems based on five criteria (information source, analysis strategy, time aspects, architecture, response) is given. Finally, intrusion detection systems are classified according to each of these categories and the most representative research prototypes are briefly described.",

abstract="Detecting anomalies in data is a vital task, with numerous high-impact applications in areas such as security, finance, health care, and law enforcement. While numerous techniques have been developed in past years for spotting outliers and anomalies in unstructured collections of multi-dimensional points, with graph data becoming ubiquitous, techniques for structured graph data have been of focus recently. As objects in graphs have long-range correlations, a suite of novel technology has been developed for anomaly detection in graph data. This survey aims to provide a general, comprehensive, and structured overview of the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection in data represented as graphs. As a key contribution, we give a general framework for the algorithms categorized under various settings: unsupervised versus (semi-)supervised approaches, for static versus dynamic graphs, for attributed versus plain graphs. We highlight the effectiveness, scalability, generality, and robustness aspects of the methods. What is more, we stress the importance of anomaly attribution and highlight the major techniques that facilitate digging out the root cause, or the `why', of the detected anomalies for further analysis and sense-making. Finally, we present several real-world applications of graph-based anomaly detection in diverse domains, including financial, auction, computer traffic, and social networks.

	abstract = {Given a stream of heterogeneous graphs containing different types of nodes and edges, how can we spot anomalous ones in real-time while consuming bounded memory? This problem is motivated by and generalizes from its application in security to host-level advanced persistent threat (APT) detection. We propose StreamSpot, a clustering based anomaly detection approach that addresses challenges in two key fronts: (1) heterogeneity, and (2) streaming nature. We introduce a new similarity function for heterogeneous graphs that compares two graphs based on their relative frequency of local substructures, represented as short strings. This function lends itself to a vector representation of a graph, which is (a) fast to compute, and (b) amenable to a sketched version with bounded size that preserves similarity. StreamSpot exhibits desirable properties that a streaming application requires: it is (i) fully-streaming; processing the stream one edge at a time as it arrives, (ii) memory-efficient; requiring constant space for the sketches and the clustering, (iii) fast; taking constant time to update the graph sketches and the cluster summaries that can process over 100,000 edges per second, and (iv) online; scoring and flagging anomalies in real time. Experiments on datasets containing simulated system-call flow graphs from normal browser activity and various attack scenarios (ground truth) show that StreamSpot is high-performance; achieving above 95\% detection accuracy with small delay, as well as competitive time and memory usage.},

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

The existing clustering algorithm in literature is the approximate algorithms, which cluster the underlying data differently for different datasets. The K-Means Clustering algorithm is suitable for frequency but not for binary form. When an application runs several system calls are implicitly invoked in the background. Based on these system calls we can predict the normal or abnormal behavior of applications. This can be done by classification. In this paper we tried to perform classification of processes running into normal and abnormal states by using system call behavior. We reduce the system call feature vector by choosing k-means algorithm which uses the proposed measure for dimensionality reduction. We give the design of the proposed measure. The proposed measure has upper and lower bounds which are finite.},

	abstract = {End-to-end tracing has emerged recently as a valuable tool to improve the dependability of distributed systems by performing dynamic verification and diagnosing cor-rectness and performance problems. End-to-end traces are commonly represented as richly annotated directed acyclic graphs, with events as nodes and their causal dependencies as edges. Being able to automatically compare these graphs at scale is a key primitive for tasks such as clustering, classification, and anomaly detection. In this paper we explore recent developments in the theory of graph kernels, and investigate the feasibility of using a family of kernels based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test [35] as an efficient and robust graph comparison primitive. We find that graph kernels provide a good formulation of the execution graph comparison problem, and present preliminary but encouraging results on their ability to distinguish high-level differences between execution graphs.},

	abstract = {Profiling the behavior of programs can be a useful reference for detecting potential intrusions against systems. This paper presents three anomaly detection techniques for profiling program behavior that evolve from memorization to generalization. The goal of monitoring program behavior is to be able to detect potential intrusions by noting irregularities in program behavior. The techniques start from a simple equality matching algorithm for determining anomalous behavior, and evolve to a feed-forward backpropagation neural network for learning program behavior, and finally to an Elman network for recognizing recurrent features in program execution traces. In order to detect future attacks against systems, intrusion detection systems must be able to generalize from past observed behavior. The goal of this research is to employ machine learning techniques that can generalize from past observed behavior to the problem of intrusion detection. The performance of these systems is compared by testing them with data provided by the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation program.},

For example, the main concern of clustering-based outlier detection algorithms is to find clusters and outliers, which are often regarded as noise that should be removed in order to make more reliable clustering. In this article, we present an algorithm that provides outlier detection and data clustering simultaneously. The algorithm improves the estimation of centroids of the generative distribution during the process of clustering and outlier discovery. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages. The first stage consists of improved genetic k-means algorithm (IGK) process, while the second stage iteratively removes the vectors which are far from their cluster centroids.},

The method is illustrated for: 1) determining the best operating point for a single and double IDS based on the costs of mistakes and the hostility of the operating environment as represented in the prior probability of intrusion and 2) evaluating single and double IDSs on the basis of expected cost. A method is also described for representing a compound IDS as an equivalent single IDS. Results are presented from the point of view of a system administrator, but they apply equally to designers of IDSs.},

In many such applications, it is useful to detect structural abnormalities which are different from the âtypicalâ behavior of the underlying network. In this paper, we will provide first results on the problem of structural outlier detection in massive network streams. Such problems are inherently challenging, because the problem of outlier detection is specially challenging because of the high volume of the underlying network stream. The stream scenario also increases the computational challenges for the approach. We use a structural connectivity model in order to define outliers in graph streams. In order to handle the sparsity problem of massive networks, we dynamically partition the network in order to construct statistically robust models of the connectivity behavior. We design a reservoir sampling method in order to maintain structural summaries of the underlying network. These structural summaries are designed in order to create robust, dynamic and efficient models for outlier detection in graph streams. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

abstract="Web graphs are approximate snapshots of the web, created by search engines. They are essential to monitor the evolution of the web and to compute global properties like PageRank values of web pages. Their continuous monitoring requires a notion of graph similarity to help measure the amount and significance of changes in the evolving web. As a result, these measurements provide means to validate how well search engines acquire content from the web. In this paper, we propose five similarity schemes: three of them we adapted from existing graph similarity measures, and two we adapted from well-known document and vector similarity methods (namely, the shingling method and random projection based method). We empirically evaluate and compare all five schemes using a sequence of web graphs from Yahoo!, and study if the schemes can identify anomalies that may occur due to hardware or other problems.",
